# What we do

IsomerCMS is a content management system (CMS) built by the Isomer team to help our users edit their content easily in a more intuitive manner. The CMS effectively replaces all editing that is done on Github to a more user friendly interface.

# Why use IsomerCMS?

#### Live preview your changes
You can preview your site as you're editing it on
IsomerCMS. No more saving changes on Github and going to your staging link to view it.

#### Integrated markdown editor and no more yaml
Instead of using an external markdown editor like
stackedit.io, IsomerCMS has the markdown editor
integrated. You don't have to worry about forgetting the syntax or messing up with your homepage due to misalignment issues on a yaml file.
